## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. A `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file will be added shortly.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Prerequisites
You will need the following tools installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version 3.11 or higher.
- **Node.js**: Version 20.x or higher.
- **pnpm**: As the preferred Node.js package manager. You can install it via `npm install -g pnpm`.
- **Git**: For version control.

### Repository Forking & Cloning
1.  **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page.
2.  **Clone your fork**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OPALproject.git
    cd OPALproject
    ```
3.  **Add the upstream remote**:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Edge-Micropayments-Inc/OPALproject.git
    ```

### Dependency Installation

The project is divided into several components. You'll need to install dependencies for each service you are working on.

#### Gateway Service (Python/FastAPI)
The gateway service uses Python. We recommend using a virtual environment.

```bash
# Navigate to the gateway service directory
cd software/gateway-service

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (once pyproject.toml or requirements.txt is created)
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Wearable Client (Node.js/React)
The wearable client is a Node.js application.

```bash
# Navigate to the wearable client directory
cd software/wearable-client

# Install dependencies using pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Recommended IDE/Editor Setup
We recommend using **Visual Studio Code** with the following extensions for a consistent development experience:

- **Python** (by Microsoft)
- **Ruff** (by Astral Software)
- **ESLint** (by Microsoft)
- **Prettier - Code formatter** (by Prettier)
- **EditorConfig for VS Code** (by EditorConfig)

## Coding Standards
Please ensure your code adheres to the standards defined in the `/standards` directory. Our CI pipeline will check for compliance.

- **Python**: Google Python Style Guide, formatted with `black` and linted with `ruff`.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: TSDoc for documentation, formatted with `Prettier` and linted with `ESLint`.

## Commit Message Guidelines
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps in automating changelog generation and makes the commit history more readable.

Example: `feat(gateway): add session creation endpoint`

## Submitting Pull Requests
1.  Keep your fork's `develop` branch up to date with the upstream `develop` branch.
2.  Create a new feature branch from your `develop` branch (e.g., `git checkout -b feat/T-109-gateway-pyproject`).
3.  Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
4.  Push your feature branch to your fork.
5.  Open a pull request from your feature branch to the upstream `develop` branch.
6.  Ensure all CI checks are passing.
7.  A project maintainer will review your PR.
